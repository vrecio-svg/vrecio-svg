# 🧠 Vanessa — AI Language Engineer & Computational Linguist

## 🤗 About Me
I'm an **AI Language Engineer** and **Computational Linguist**. I contribute to **generative AI solutions**, designing prompts, running experiments, and evaluating model performance, while collaborating with the team on deployment.

As part of a cross-functional team, I contributed to implementing a generative AI approach for handling customer service FAQs across **10+ countries and languages**, automating around **50% of incoming contacts**.  
We also migrated the client’s intent classification system from a deprecated **deep learning model (Vertex AI)** to a **generative classifier powered by Gemini**, after evaluating alternatives such as **BERT**.  
Additionally, we helped **extend the classification pipeline to handle customer emails**, expanding automation beyond chat and messaging channels.  

With a background in **localization** and fluency in **Spanish, English, and German**, I bring a deep understanding of linguistic and cultural nuances — an essential asset when designing AI strategies for **multilingual and international products**.  

My work sits at the intersection of **linguistics, data analysis, and AI engineering**, and my long-term goal is to grow into an **NLP Data Scientist** — someone who builds, analyzes, and improves models that understand human language.
